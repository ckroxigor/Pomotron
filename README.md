## Why Pomotron?

I recently upgraded my operating system. I am currently using Ubuntu Mate 16.04 64-bits. Before I was using an excellent pomodoro timer [gnome-pomodoro](http://gnomepomodoro.org/) but it was no longer compatible with my desktop. I looked for many options freely available online and none of them convinced me, so I implemented one cross-platform solution.
